# EM_GaussianMixtureModel_TaskDurations
 Expectation Maximization to build Gaussian mixture models of the duration of task executions.
 I discovered some cool Simpsom Paradox phenomenon for certain professions. For less skilled groups, taking longer to finish a task is related to being clueless, whereas to other professional groups is being thorough. Cluelessness and thoroughness were determined by the effect of task duration on the accuracy of the task.

## Bimodality Studies
We also investigated how participant grpups vary w.r.t. to bimodality in the task duration distribution. For that we computed bimodality metrics and correlations with years of programming experience and the score obtained in the tests. For details on that check the scripts in the folder bimodality_studies.
